  <h1 id='title'>Sorry! Bunny Defender has been taken down.</h1>
  <p id='explanation'>
    BunnyDefender was a game I built just to test around with. It is not a game that I am proud of or support. In fact, I despise games like Bunny Defender because they are pointless. They leave the user with nothing but lost time. I don't want to be responsible for taking away the precious minutes we have in our lives from anyone.

  <h3>It’s all in the idea</h3>
  <p id='vision'> If you believe in your idea from within your heart, it will be great.<strong>Truly worthy applications</strong>, be they games or services, have an idea, a vision behind them. Do I want my vision to be, “Let’s see how many 8th graders I can get addicted to my game.” ? No, my apps should be forms of expression, an extension of the self. My apps should define the person who makes them: <em>me</em>. I should strive to tell a story with my app, to give the user something to walk away with other than an empty bank account. 

We have to look deeply within ourselves and forget about the art, the sound effects, and all the code. Just ask ourselves: </p>
<h1 id='bang'>What do we want to tell the world?</h1>
